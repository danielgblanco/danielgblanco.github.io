I joined [Michael Hausenblas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhausenblas/) on the first episode of his new
[OpenTelemetry In Use](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Qr2q1WyNvXI5d2jSvl0rC) podcast, where we discussed how
Skyscanner migrated from OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry with zero friction thanks to the shared API design of these
projects, and the value of open standards to reduce maintenance toil and cognitive load for engineers maintaining complex
distributed systems.
