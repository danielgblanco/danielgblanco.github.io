This was a really fun conversation with [Martin Thwaites](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martindotnet/) and
[Jessica Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicakerr/) on a new episode of
[O11ycast](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-70-evangelizing-observability-with-dan-gomez-blanco-of-skyscanner).
We talked about my approach to evangelise better observability practices at Skyscanner, and some of my experience on
joining the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee. We got serious about minimising organisational costs, and nerded out
about the future of auto-instrumentation, with some advice on detecting and avoiding over-instrumentation.
