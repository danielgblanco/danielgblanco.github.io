[Juraci Paixão Kröhling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpkroehling/) and I had the pleasure of joining
[Mat Ryer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matryer/) and [Matt Toback](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toback/) on a new episode
of [Grafana Big Tent](https://bigtent.fm/s2/9) where we took a deep dive into the evolution of OTel from its early days
(including the story of how OTel got its name) to its current state and future roadmap.

_JinglOTel, JinglOTel, Jingle all the way!_
