# About Me

<img src="/assets/img/profile_800x800.png" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin-right: 12px"/>

I'm a Principal Strategic Solutions Architect at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), supporting customers in their journey to drive adoption of
best practices in observability and operational readiness across their engineering teams. Although maybe the term
was not so popular when I started, I previously worked as a Platform Engineer for over 12 years in organisations such as [CERN](https://cern.ch/)
or [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/), where I led observability with a focus on tool consolidation, adoption of open standards like
OpenTelemetry, and building a culture of operational excellence. You may also recognise me from contributions to
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), where I'm part of the Governance Committee since 2023. In my free time I tend to start way too many
hobbies, but drumming and photography are the ones that consistently keep me going.
