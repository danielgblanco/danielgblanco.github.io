# About Me

<img src="/assets/img/profile_800x800.png" style="float: left; width: 180px; margin-right: 12px"/>

I'm a Principal Strategic Solutions Architect at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), supporting customers in their journey to drive
adoption of best practices in observability and operational readiness across their engineering teams. Although maybe
the term Platform Engineering was not so popular when I started my career, this is what I did for over 12 years before
joining New Relic, in organisations such as [CERN](https://cern.ch/) or [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/), where I ultimately led the rearchitecture
of its observability platform with a focus on tool consolidation, adoption of open standards like OpenTelemetry, and
building a culture of operational excellence. You may also recognise me from contributions to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/),
where I'm part of the Governance Committee since 2023. In my free time I tend to start way too many hobbies, but
drumming and photography are the ones that consistently keep me going.
