Although maybe the term Platform Engineering was not so popular when I started my career, this is what I did for over 12 years before joining New Relic, in organisations such as CERN or Skyscanner, where I ultimately led the re-architecture of its observability platform with a focus on tool consolidation, adoption of open standards like OpenTelemetry, and building a culture of operational excellence. You may also recognise me from contributions to OpenTelemetry, where I've been part of the Governance Committee since 2023. In my free time I tend to start way too many hobbies, but drumming and photography are the ones that consistently keep me going.</p>"},{"location":"#like-and-subscribe","title":"Like and Subscribe","text":"<p>Check out the links in the footer if you want to follow me on social networks, or subscribe to my RSS feed to get updates on articles, podcasts, and videos as they're being published.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"All Content","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:beyond-the-hype","title":"Beyond the Hype","text":"<ul> <li>            Beyond the Hype          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:bioinformatics","title":"Bioinformatics","text":"<ul> <li>            ALTER: program-oriented conversion of DNA and protein alignments          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:databases","title":"Databases","text":"<ul> <li>            DB On Demand          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:grafana-big-tent","title":"Grafana Big Tent","text":"<ul> <li>            Grafana Big Tent          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:kubecon","title":"KubeCon","text":"<ul> <li>            OpenTelemetry in Five Minutes          </li> <li>            OpenTelemetry: Project Update          </li> <li>            OpenTelemetry: Project Updates, Next Steps, and AMA          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:o11ycast","title":"O11ycast","text":"<ul> <li>            O11ycast          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:o11yfest","title":"O11yfest","text":"<ul> <li>            How to Transparently Migrate 300+ Services to OpenTelemetry          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:observability-day","title":"Observability Day","text":"<ul> <li>            OpenTelemetry: Bridging Platform and Enablement          </li> <li>            OpenTelemetry: Realising the Value of Open Standards          </li> <li>            Shift Into an Observability Mindset with OpenTelemetry          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:observability-engineering","title":"Observability Engineering","text":"<ul> <li>            Building an Observability Mindset at Skyscanner          </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/tags/#tag:opentelemetry","title":"OpenTelemetry","text":"<ul> <li>            Beyond the Hype          </li> <li>            Building an Observability Mindset at Skyscanner          </li> <li>            Effective and Efficient Observability with OpenTelemetry          </li> <li>            Grafana Big Tent          </li> <li>            Holiday Sweaters &amp;
